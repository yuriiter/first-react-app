# This is my first React app

This is an application that reads .json file and stores the information into the table.
You can sort the information by different values in ascending or descending order, change the view (the table and the tiles with video) and change the language.

## Getting started

You can view a live demo over at https://react-redux.realworld.io/

To get the frontend running locally:

- Clone this repo
- `npm install` to install all req'd dependencies
- `npm start` to start the local server (this project uses create-react-app)
